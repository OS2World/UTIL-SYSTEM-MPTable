<h1><a name="SECTION00040000000000000000">
Interrupt Controllers (Stuff in the Middle)</a>
</h1>

<p>
Interrupt controllers on the x86 platform are responsible for
receiving interrupt signals from devices, mapping the signal to an IDT
vector, and then interrupting one or more CPUs in the system with the
IDT vector.  The x86 platform has some extra quirks, however.  First,
due to limitations with the original interrupt controllers and busses
used on the PC-AT, separate programmable interrupt routers were added
to the platform to sit in between PCI interrupt signals and the PC-AT
interrupt controllers.  Second, as the x86 platform continued to
progress, an entirely new set of interrupt controllers, known as
Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controllers (APICs), were introduced.
In order to preserve backwards compatibility, systems with APICs also
still include the PC-AT interrupt controllers and either system can be
used to handle interrupts on modern systems.  It is even possible to
use both at the same time though doing so is discouraged.

<p>

<h2><a name="SECTION00041000000000000000">
8259A Master and Slave PICs (PC-AT)</a>
</h2>

<p>
The original PC-AT included two 8259A Programmable Interrupt
Controllers (PICs) chained together.  As with many other aspects of
the PC-AT, this setup became part of the de facto standard for the x86
platform.  Each 8259A has eight interrupt input signals that are
assigned to eight consecutive IDT vectors.  Two PICs thus yields
sixteen total interrupt inputs.  On the PC-AT these signals were known
as ISA IRQs 0 through 15.  However, the second 8259A (known as the
slave PIC) is connected to the third input pin on the first 8259A
(known as the master PIC).  Thus, ISA IRQ 2 is not available for
device interrupts, and there are really only fifteen interrupt inputs
available for device interrupts.

<p>
The original PC-AT also used an ISA bus for its devices.  ISA
interrupts are edge triggered and are asserted by having the device
raise the signal from low to high.  This inhibits sharing of ISA
interrupts by multiple devices, so each ISA device requires a
dedicated interrupt input on the 8259As.  All PC-AT compatible systems
included an ISA timer which used IRQ 0, a keyboard controller that
used IRQ 1, and a real time clock which used IRQ 8.  The optional
floating point co-processor used IRQ 13 if it was present.  When PCI
was introduced, most PC-AT compatible systems included two serial
ports which used IRQs 3 and 4, a floppy controller which used IRQ 6, a
line printer port which used IRQ 7, a PS/2 mouse port which used IRQ
12, and two IDE controllers which used IRQs 14 and 15.  This left only
IRQs 5, 9, 10, and 11 for PCI interrupts to use.

<p>
To make matters even more complicated many systems included other ISA
devices such as additional serial or printer ports or sound cards.
Each of these additional ISA devices also required a dedicated IRQ.
Sound cards, for example, often used IRQ 5.  Thus, the set of IRQs
available for use by PCI interrupts was not fixed.  Rather, simply
adding or removing an ISA peripheral could change the set across
reboots.  To deal with this complication, programmable interrupt
routers were added.

<p>

<h2><a name="SECTION00042000000000000000">
Programmable Interrupt Routers (PCI Link Devices)</a>
</h2>

<p>
A programmable interrupt router is used to route PCI interrupt signals
to interrupt inputs on another interrupt controller.  A router
contains several input signals and output signals.  Each output signal
is hooked up to an input on an interrupt controller.  Each input
signal can be routed to one of the output signals.  Multiple input
signals can be routed to the same output signal.  Multiple PCI
interrupt signals can be routed to a single input signal.

<p>
System software, such as the BIOS or operating system, is responsible
for programming the interrupt router.  Programming the router consists
of routing each input signal that is in use to an output signal.  For
example, a PC-AT compatible system might have the output pins from the
programmable interrupt router hooked up to the interrupt lines for
IRQs 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, and 11 on the 8259A PICs.  If IRQs 3, 4, and 7
are in use by ISA devices, then each input pin on the interrupt router
must be routed to one of the IRQs 5, 9, 10, or 11.  Note that routing
a single input pin (also known as a PCI Link Device) to an IRQ routes
all of the PCI interrupts connected to that input pin to the IRQ.
That is, one can't arbitrarily route individual PCI interrupts at
will.  Instead, one can only route a group of PCI interrupts that are
connected to an input pin.  This grouping is set in the hardware and
cannot be altered by system software.  Also, if a system has more
input pins than available IRQs, then at least some of the input pins
will be routed to the same IRQ resulting in the union of all the PCI
interrupts on those input pins sharing the same IRQ.

<p>
An example of using a programmable interrupt router in combination
with the 8259A PICs can be found in Figure&nbsp;<a href="#8259A_PIR">1</a>.  On the
left are six PCI slots.  The <tt>INTA#</tt> pin from each slot is
connected to one of the input pins on the interrupt router, which is
labeled ``PIR.''  Notice that some of the PCI interrupts are wired to
the same input pin on the interrupt router.  For example, the first
two interrupts are both connected to the <tt>LNKA</tt> input pin.  The
interrupt router also has four output pins that are connected to input
pins on the two 8259A controllers corresponding to IRQs 5, 9, 10, and
11.  Suppose that <tt>LNKA</tt> is routed to <tt>O0</tt>,
<tt>LNKB</tt> is routed to <tt>O1</tt>, <tt>LNKC</tt> is routed to
<tt>O2</tt>, and <tt>LNKD</tt> is routed to <tt>00</tt>.  Then the
interrupts for PCI slots 0, 1, and 5 would be routed to IRQ 5.  The
interrupt for PCI slot 2 would be routed to IRQ 11, and the interrupts
for PCI slots 3 and 4 would be routed to IRQ 10.

<p>
Many x86 systems, including most recent systems, include a second set
of interrupt controllers known as APICs.  In these systems, each CPU
includes a local APIC which receives interrupt messages and uses them
to assert interrupts on the CPU.  The chipset includes one or more I/O
APICs which are responsible for converting device interrupt signals
into messages that are delivered to one or more local APICs.

<p>
One of the biggest differences between the 8259A PICs and I/O APICs is
that the pins on I/O APICs are completely independent.  With the 8259A
PICs, the eight input pins are mapped to eight consecutive IDT
vectors, and all of the interrupts are sent to the same CPU.  I/O
APICs, on the other hand, do not have any controller-wide settings.
Instead, each pin is programmed independently.  Each pin is assigned
its own IDT vector by the operating system and can be mapped to one or
more CPUs.  I/O APICs can also contain a variable number of pins.
Typically an I/O APIC contains 16, 24, or 32 input pins.

<p>
PCI interrupt signals are routed to I/O APIC interrupt pins in several
different ways.  The earliest APIC systems include a single I/O APIC
with 16 input pins that simply replicate the functionality of the two
8259A PICs.  In these systems, the 16 input pins are used for the 16
ISA IRQs, and PCI interrupts are routed onto the ISA IRQs using a
programmable interrupt router.  Most APIC systems, however, use
dedicated I/O APIC input pins for PCI interrupt signals.  In these
systems, the first 16 pins on the first I/O APIC are used for the 16
ISA IRQs.  PCI interrupt signals are connected to other input pins on
the first I/O APIC (if it contains more than 16 input pins) as well as
input pins on additional I/O APICs (if present).  Some very recent
systems have begun routing some of the PCI interrupt signals to a
programmable interrupt router whose output pins are connected to a set
of I/O APIC input pins that are dedicated to PCI interrupts.

<p>
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#IOAPIC_direct">2</a> contains an example of a system with a
24-pin I/O APIC where the PCI interrupts are connected directly to
input pins on the I/O APIC.  As with the previous figure, there are
six PCI slots on the left, and the <tt>INTA#</tt> pin from each slot
is connected to one of the input pins on the I/O APIC.  A system may
still have shared PCI interrupts even when using APICs if multiple
interrupt lines are connected to the same I/O APIC input pin.  For
example, the first two interrupts for PCI slots 0 and 1 are both
connected to <tt>I20</tt> input pin.  The other interrupts are all
routed to their own input pin: PCI slots 2, 3, 4, and 5 are routed to
input pins <tt>I19</tt>, <tt>I18</tt>, <tt>I17</tt>, and <tt>I16</tt>,
respectively.
