<p>
The PCI interrupt code in FreeBSD has been designed and implemented by
several different people.  Mike Smith and Warner Losh provided the
initial support for PCI interrupt routing including support for using
the $PIR routing table.  Mike and Warner also conceived the idea of
PCI busses asking their parent bridge driver to route interrupts.
Mike also implemented the initial support for routing interrupts via
the ACPI <tt>_PRT</tt> tables.  Mitsuru Iwasaki and Nate Lawson
implemented the first pci link management driver.

<p>
The work I have done on PCI interrupts was also greatly aided by
others.  Enhancements to the existing PCI routing code were sponsored
by The Weather Channel, while the MSI code was sponsored by Yahoo!.
Both companies sponsored my time and provided hardware for testing.

<p>
My biggest debt is owed to Mike Smith, however.  Several years ago
Mike sat down with me and explained exactly what the interrupt routing
information in the MP Table meant and why the existing code in FreeBSD
4.x needed to be improved.  He also encouraged me to work on ACPI and
PCI interrupt routing general.  On an even broader scale, Mike
mentored me as a I transitioned from working on FreeBSD documentation
to hacking on the source to the FreeBSD kernel including my work on
SMP, ACPI, and PCI support.
