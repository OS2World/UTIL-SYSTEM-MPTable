Introduction</a>
</h1>

<p>
Interrupts are an important part of device support in modern machines.
They allow system software to use event-driven algorithms instead of
polling.  This in turn can allow for much more efficient use of system
resources such as CPU time, especially in systems with multiple
devices operating concurrently.

<p>
One of the tasks an operating system must perform when handling device
interrupts is to determine which device needs attention when an
interrupt is asserted.  This mapping can be done several different
ways.  Some systems may include this mapping information in a static
table hard-coded into the operating system or firmware.  Other systems
may use dynamic mappings with programmable hardware, and still other
systems may use a combination.

<p>
PCI allows devices to assert interrupts in two very different styles.
The first style consists of dedicated sideband signals and is known as
Legacy INTx interrupts.  The second style consists of special memory
writes that are sent over the data bus just like DMA operations and is
known as Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI).  MSI interrupts are only
available on newer devices as it is a recent addition to the PCI
standards.

<p>
First, however, a brief segue into nomenclature.  In PCI, the term
``device'' actually refers to a piece of hardware that contains from
one to eight ``functions''.  A typical x86 chipset may include several
USB controllers as functions of a single PCI device for example.  A
PCI expansion slot is a PCI device, and a single expansion card may
contain multiple functions.  However, from the operating system's
perspective, each function on a PCI device is a logical operating
system device.  For example, on both Darwin and FreeBSD, each function
of a multi-function PCI device receives its own device object and can
be served by different drivers.  To attempt to avoid confusion, the
rest of this paper will use the term ``slot'' for a PCI device and
will only use ``device'' to refer to a logical operating system
device.
