<h1><a name="SECTION00060000000000000000">
FreeBSD's INTx Implementation</a>
</h1>

<p>
FreeBSD's PCI interrupt routing code attempts to provide a machine
independent framework that machine dependent code can hook into where
necessary.  First, FreeBSD uses cookie values defined by machine
dependent code for <tt>SYS_RES_IRQ</tt> resources.  This provides a
way to handle interrupts in machine independent code and interfaces.
Second, when the PCI bus needs to route an interrupt it passes the
request up the device tree until it reaches a level where the request
can be handled.

<p>
All interrupt resources in FreeBSD drivers are managed as
<tt>SYS_RES_IRQ</tt> resources.  When a driver wants to use an
interrupt, it allocates a <tt>SYS_RES_IRQ</tt> resource in much the
same way it allocates memory or I/O space.  The driver can then attach
an interrupt handler to that resource.  When a PCI device attempts to
allocate a INTx interrupt, the PCI bus first routes it to an IRQ value
that is used to create the <tt>SYS_RES_IRQ</tt> resource.  It does
this by asking its parent device, which is either a Host-PCI or
PCI-PCI bridge, to look up the IRQ for the given PCI interrupt.  The
different interrupt routing algorithms are then implemented in
different drivers for Host-PCI and PCI-PCI bridge drivers.

<p>
The simplest PCI bridge driver is the PCI-PCI bridge driver.  This
driver's interrupt routing routine implements the swizzle defined in
Section&nbsp;<a href="node5.html#swizzle">5.1</a> by calculating the corresponding slot and pin on
the upstream side of the bridge and passing the request up to the PCI
bridge driver for the upstream PCI bus.  Thus, routing requests for
interrupts on busses that are not part of the main chassis will bubble
up through the device tree until they hit a bridge for a PCI bus that
is part of the main chassis.

<p>
Interrupt routing for PCI busses that are part of the main chassis
is handled by machine dependent PCI bridge drivers.  For example, if
ACPI is enabled, then ACPI will probe and attach to all the PCI
bridges in the ACPI namespace.  When an interrupt routing request
reaches a PCI bridge with an ACPI driver, it will use the
<tt>_PRT</tt> for the corresponding PCI bus to determine the GSI for
the PCI interrupt.  It then maps the GSI to a <tt>SYS_RES_IRQ</tt>
cookie value which it returns.  Thus, the machine dependent code is
responsible for mapping platform-specific interrupts to
<tt>SYS_RES_IRQ</tt> cookies in the PCI bridge drivers.  Then in the
top-level root, or nexus, devices in the device tree, the machine
dependent code is responsible for mapping the <tt>SYS_RES_IRQ</tt>
resources back to the platform-specific interrupts.

<p>
FreeBSD does allow the user to override the IRQ for any given PCI
interrupt via a tunable.  The format for this tunable is
<tt>hw.pci<i>bus</i>.<i>slot</i>.INT<i>pin</i>.irq</tt> where
<i>bus</i> is the PCI bus number, <i>slot</i> is the PCI slot number,
and <i>pin</i> is the intpin (<tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt>, <tt>C</tt>, or
<tt>D</tt>).  The value of the tunable is the IRQ to use for the
specified PCI interrupt.  This tunable should only be used as a last
resort when there aren't more specific tunables (such as the PCI link
tunables) available.  One instance in which this tunable is useful is
correcting hard-wired routing to I/O APIC intpins due to a broken MP
Table or <tt>_PRT</tt> entry.  For example, to route the PCI
interrupt for bus 0, slot 16, <tt>INTA#</tt> to IRQ 24, set the
loader tunable <tt>hw.pci0.16.INTA.irq=24</tt>.

<p>

<h2><a name="SECTION00061000000000000000">
IRQs are Yummy Cookies</a>
</h2>

<p>
For the x86 platforms, FreeBSD models the mapping of IRQ values to
platform interrupts on the Global System Interrupts approach from
ACPI.  In fact, when using ACPI FreeBSD uses the GSI values directly
as IRQs.  FreeBSD also always maps IRQ values 0 through 15 to the
sixteen ISA IRQs.  The only remaining case is when using the MP Table
to enumerate APICs and route interrupts.  For this case, the MP Table
code simulates the GSI approach by assigning suitable base IRQ values
to each I/O APIC similar to th base GSI values used by ACPI.  The MP
Table code calculates the base IRQs by adding the number of input pins
on each I/O APIC to the base IRQ of the current I/O APIC to determine
the base IRQ of the next I/O APIC.  Thus, if you have a system with
three I/O APICs where the first two I/O APICs have 24 pins and the
third I/O APIC has 16 pins, the first I/O APIC would be assigned IRQs
0-23, the second I/O APIC would be assigned IRQs 24-47, and the last
I/O APIC would be assigned IRQs 48-63.

<p>
The x86 platforms use a global array indexed by the IRQ value to map
the IRQs to platform interrupts.  Each entry in the array is a pointer
to an interrupt source object.  Interrupt source objects consist of a
<tt>struct intsrc</tt> which contains a pointer to a group of function
pointers in a <tt>struct pic</tt>.  One can think of <tt>struct
intsrc</tt> and <tt>struct pic</tt> as abstract base classes.  Each
interrupt controller driver provides its own extended versions of
<tt>struct pic</tt> and <tt>struct intsrc</tt>.  The extended
versions contain the base structure as the first member and add
driver-specific data after that.  For example, the I/O APIC code
defines a <tt>struct ioapic</tt> which extends <tt>struct pic</tt>.
Each instance of <tt>struct ioapic</tt> contains functions for
managing I/O APIC input pins in its method table.  It also defines a
<tt>struct ioapic_intsrc</tt> which extends <tt>struct intsrc</tt> to
add I/O APIC-specific data such as which I/O APIC input pin an
interrupt source represents.  The interrupt controller drivers
determine the IRQ values for each interrupt source object.  Thus, they
must ensure the IRQ properly matches up with the IRQ value used for
any PCI interrupts routed to that interrupt source.

<p>

<h2><a name="SECTION00062000000000000000">
IDT Vectors on x86</a>
</h2>

<p>
Once the operating system has mapped a PCI interrupt to an interrupt
source, the only remaining step for x86 platforms is mapping the
interrupt source to an IDT vector.  IDT vectors range from 0 to 255,
and IDT vectors 0-31 are reserved for CPU faults and exceptions and
NMIs.  In addition, FreeBSD uses vectors 240-255 for IPIs, vector 239
for the local APIC timer interrupt, and vector 128 for system calls.
That leaves vectors 32-127 and 129-238 for device interrupts.

<p>
The 8259As each require 8 contiguous IDT vectors.  They each can also
interrupt the CPU even when all input pins are masked if a spurious
interrupt occurs.  Thus, vectors 32-47 are reserved for the 8259As,
even when APICs are used instead of the 8259As.

<p>
The rest of the device interrupts are allocated on an as-needed basis
to active interrupt sources.  For example, I/O APIC input pins
allocate an IDT vector the first time an interrupt handler is
registered.  Most I/O APIC input pins are never used, so this strategy
avoids reserving IDT vectors for interrupt sources that will never
trigger.
