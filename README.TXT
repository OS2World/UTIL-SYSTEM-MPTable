                         MPTABLE 2.0.12.

This is port of known FreeBSD mptable tool to OS/2 and QSINIT
(see http://ru2.halfos.ru/core).
The original version of this tool is located at http://people.freebsd.org/~fsmp/SMP/
This tool dumps various tables defined by MultiProcessor Specification 1.4 and
doesn't require any SMP support installed in the system.

This package also includes copy of "PCI Interrupts for x86 Machines under
FreeBSD" article from http://people.freebsd.org/~jhb/papers/bsdcan/2007/article
because it is great and detailed popular description of MPS compatible systems
internals. In particular it explains what are these cool numbers in MPTable
mean.
