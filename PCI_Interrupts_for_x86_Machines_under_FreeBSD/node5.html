PCI Interrupt Routing (Navigating the Maze)</a>
</h1>

<p>
PCI interrupt routing consists of figuring out which platform-specific
interrupt is asserted when a given PCI interrupt signal is asserted.
On x86 machines, this consists of figuring out which input pin on an
interrupt controller is asserted when a given PCI interrupt signal is
asserted.  This can include a detour through a programmable interrupt
router in between the PCI interrupt signal and the interrupt
controller.

<h2><a name="SECTION00051000000000000000"></a><a name="swizzle"></a>
<br>
PCI-PCI Bridge Swizzle
</h2>

<p>
Most PCI interrupt routing information is platform-specific; however,
the PCI specification does define a specific case where interrupt
routing is platform independent.  Specifically, if an add-in card
contains its own PCI-PCI bridge, then the interrupt pins are for the
PCI slots behind the PCI-PCI bridge are mapped onto the interrupt pins
on the upstream side of the PCI-PCI bridge.

<p>
If you assign the values 0 - 3 to <tt>INTA#</tt> - <tt>INTD#</tt>
then the mapping can be described as:

<p>
<br><p></p>
<div align="CENTER">

</div>
<br clear="ALL">
<p></p>

<p>
where <IMG
 WIDTH="66" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="\( pin_{parent} \)"> is the upstream interrupt pin on the PCI-PCI
bridge and <IMG

 ALT="\( slot_{child} \)"> and <IMG
 WIDTH="56" HEIGHT="29" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="\( pin_{child} \)"> are the PCI slot
and pin, respectively, of the interrupt signal being routed across the
bridge.  Thus, <tt>INTA#</tt> of slot 0 is mapped to <tt>INTA#</tt>
on the bridge.  For slot 1, <tt>INTA#</tt> is mapped to
<tt>INTB#</tt> on the bridge, and <tt>INTD#</tt> is mapped to
<tt>INTA#</tt> on the bridge.  A full table of the mapping can be
found in Table 24-13 of <i>PCI System Architecture</i>&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node12.html#PCI">5</a>].

<p>
Although the PCI specification only defines this routing for PCI-PCI
bridges in add-in cards, some x86 systems also use this mapping for
PCI slots behind PCI-PCI bridges that are not in add-in cards but are
part of the main chassis.  The rule there appears to be that if no
other routing information is provided by the BIOS for a given PCI bus
behind a PCI-PCI bridge, the above mapping should be used to route the
interrupts across the PCI-PCI bridge to the parent PCI bus.

<p>

<h2><a name="SECTION00052000000000000000">
Routing via $PIR</a>
</h2>

<p>
The first PCI interrupt routing table provided by the x86 BIOS is the
$PIR table, so named for it's four character signature: ``$PIR''.
This table describes how PCI interrupt signals are connected to input
pins on a programmable interrupt router.  In addition, it provides
details that can be used by the operating system to either program the
interrupt router directly or to ask the PCI BIOS to route individual
links.  Note that the $PIR table only knows about ISA IRQs, so it
cannot in general be used with APIC.  An exception to this rule is
that some early APIC systems only route ISA IRQs via their sole I/O
APIC and still use an programmable interrupt router and a $PIR table
to route PCI interrupts onto ISA IRQs.  Details on the format and
layout of the $PIR table can be found in pages 233 - 238 of <i>PCI
System Architecture</i>&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node12.html#PCI">5</a>].

<p>

<h3><a name="SECTION00052100000000000000">
The $PIR Table</a>
</h3>

<p>
The main body of the $PIR table consists of a variable-sized array of
slot entries.  Each slot entry contains details about a single PCI
slot such as whether or not the slot is an embedded device in the main
chassis or whether the slot represents a physical slot on the
motherboard.  Each slot entry also contains an array of four pin
entries containing the routing information for <tt>INTA#</tt>,
<tt>INTB#</tt>, <tt>INTC#</tt>, and <tt>INTD#</tt> for the slot.
Each pin entry contains a byte holding a link identifier and a bitmap
of valid ISA IRQs for this pin entry.  Since each slot entry always
contains pin entries for all four pins, but not all slots on embedded
devices use all four pins, a pin can be marked as disconnected by
using a link identifier of zero.

<p>
Each non-zero link identifier refers to a specific input pin on the
programmable interrupt router.  Thus, all of the (slot, pin) entries
that have the same link identifier are all physically connected to the
same input pin and will always share the same interrupt.  Also,
routing a link to an IRQ routes all of the (slot, pin) entries
connected to that link to that IRQ.

<p>
Routing a PCI interrupt to an ISA IRQ using $PIR is a mostly
straightforward process.  First, the bus, slot, and pin of the PCI
interrupt to be routed are used to lookup a (slot, pin) entry in the
$PIR table.  The link for the PCI interrupt is then taken from the
(slot, pin) entry.  If the link is already routed to an IRQ, then the
routing is complete.  Otherwise, an IRQ must be chosen and the link
must be routed to the IRQ.

<p>
Once the operating system has picked an IRQ for an unrouted link,
there are two ways the link can be routed to that IRQ.  First, the
operating system can manually program the interrupt router to route
the link.  Second, the PCI BIOS provides a BIOS call to route an
individual link to a specific IRQ.

<p>
To aid with the first approach, the $PIR table includes the PCI
location (bus, slot, and function) and device ID of the interrupt
router.  The device ID can be used to determine an interrupt router
driver.  For some routers, for example, the programming model is that
the link identifier in the (slot, pin) entries is the offset of a
single byte register and that the IRQ to be used is written to the
register to route the link.  This approach requires the operating
system to maintain several different interrupt router drivers, and new
routers aren't supported until a new driver is written or an existing
driver updated.

<p>

<h3><a name="SECTION00052200000000000000">
FreeBSD's $PIR Implementation</a>
</h3>

<p>
To support $PIR routing, FreeBSD maintains data about each link that
appears in the $PIR table.  During boot, the kernel walks the $PIR
table to build a list of links and allocate per-link data such as
whether or not the link is routed, and which IRQ it is routed to.  The
kernel also determines if each link has already been routed by the
BIOS (and if so, to which IRQ).  To do this, it walks each slot entry
in the $PIR table.  It then examines the intpin and intline PCI
config registers for each function at the PCI bus and slot specified
in the slot entry.  If a function has a valid intline config register,
then the kernel assumes that the BIOS has routed the link associated
with this function to the IRQ in the intline register.  It determines
the link by using the intpin register to index the pin entry in the
$PIR slot entry.  The kernel also builds the bitmap of valid IRQs
for each link during this table walk.  In theory, all of the (slot,
pin) entries that refer to the same link should have the same bitmap
of valid IRQs.  In practice, this is not always the case.  As a
result, FreeBSD uses the intersection of the various bitmaps (via a
bitwise AND) to determine the bitmap of valid IRQs for a given link.

<p>
The trickiest part of $PIR routing is figuring out which IRQ to use
for a link that was not routed by the BIOS.  FreeBSD uses a rather
conservative approach that favors reliability at the expense of
possibly forcing more interrupt sharing than is strictly necessary.
If the link has only one valid IRQ in its bitmap, then that IRQ
is used.  However, if there is more than one valid IRQ, the process is
slightly more complex.  When the kernel does its initial scan of the
$PIR table to build the per-link data, it also builds a bitmap of
IRQs that the BIOS used to route links.  Then when it comes time to
pick an IRQ for an unrouted link, the kernel will try to use one of
the IRQs that the BIOS used as those IRQs are known to work.  If none
of the IRQs used by the BIOS are valid for the link, then the kernel
tries to use one of the IRQs in a system-wide bitmap of PCI-only IRQs
in the $PIR header.  If the kernel is still not able to find an IRQ
at this point, it tries to pick an IRQ from a static bitmap of IRQs.

<p>
FreeBSD just uses the PCI BIOS call to route a link to an IRQ to avoid
the maintenance overhead of interrupt router drivers.  While some
older systems may not include the BIOS call, these older systems also
will typically route all the links to IRQs during boot (or provide a
BIOS option to do so).  Thus, for these systems the ability to route
links is not critical.

<p>
An example of the link table portion of the output from
<tt>pirtool</tt> can be find in Figure&nbsp;<a href="#pirtool">3</a>.  This machine
contains at least six different links: 0x60, 0x61, 0x62, 0x63, 0x68,
and 0x6b.  The first entry indicates that the <tt>INTA#</tt> pin for
slot 2 on bus 0 is connected to the 0x60 link, for example.  This
machine only has one expansion slot, and the four intpins in that slot
are routed to links 0x62, 0x63, 0x60, and 0x61.

<p>
FreeBSD allows the user to tweak the $PIR routing via loader
tunables.  First, the bitmap of IRQs used as the last resort when
choosing an IRQ for an unrouted IRQ can be set via
<tt>hw.pci.irq_override_mask</tt>.  Probably more useful, however, is
the ability to specify the IRQ for individual links.  The tunable for
this is <tt>hw.pci.link.<i>link</i>.irq</tt> where <i>link</i> is the
link to route, and the value of the tunable is the IRQ to route the
link to.  The <i>link</i> is specified as a hexadecimal value with a
leading ``0x'' identical to the output from <tt>pirtool</tt> as well
as all kernel output containing $PIR link identifiers.  For example,
to route link 0x60 to IRQ 11, set the loader tunable
<tt>hw.pci.link.0x60.irq=11</tt>.  Any IRQs used in user-specified
routings are included in the mask of IRQs used by the BIOS when
choosing IRQs for unrouted links.  Thus, if a BIOS routes only some
links and routes them all to IRQ 10, but IRQ 11 is known to be free
for PCI interrupts, one can force the system to route one or more of
the unrouted links to IRQ 11 to split some of the interrupt load
simply by routing a single link to IRQ 11 using a tunable.

<h2><a name="SECTION00053000000000000000">
Routing via the MP Table</a>
</h2>

<p>
When APIC was introduced on x86, a new table was introduced to
describe the routing of PCI interrupts to I/O APIC input pins.  This
table is known as the MP Table, and its format is described in the
Multiprocessor Specification&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node12.html#mpspec">4</a>].  The MP Table contains
several different types of entries including entries enumerating
processors and I/O APICs.  It also contains entries describing all
device interrupts that are connected to I/O APIC input pins, and these
entries are used for routing PCI interrupts.

<p>
Each interrupt entry in the MP Table contains a device interrupt as
the source, and an I/O APIC input pin as the destination.  The source
interrupt contains a bus type (such as ISA or PCI), a bus ID, and an
IRQ value.  For PCI interrupts, the bus ID is the PCI bus number of
the slot the interrupt belongs to.  The IRQ value contains both the
PCI slot and intpin.  The lower two bits contain the intpin (0 means
<tt>INTA#</tt>, etc.), and bits 2 through 6 contain the slot.  The
destination is specified as an APIC ID of an I/O APIC and an input pin
number.

<p>
Given this, routing a PCI interrupt using the MP Table is fairly
simple.  The kernel simply walks the MP Table until it finds an entry
whose source interrupt matches the PCI bus, slot, and intpin.  It then
uses the destination I/O APIC input pin as the PCI interrupt's
destination.

An example of the interrupt entries output from <tt>mptable(8)</tt>
can be find in Figure&nbsp;<a href="#mptable">4</a>.  This system contains three I/O
APICs with APIC IDs of 8, 9, and 10.  The ISA IRQs are connected to
the first sixteen pins on the first I/O APIC.  The PCI interrupts for
PCI busses 0 and 4 are connected to other pins on the first I/O APIC.
The only PCI interrupt on PCI bus 2 is connected to the first pin on
the second I/O APIC, and the PCI interrupts on PCI bus 3 are connected
to the first four pins on the third I/O APIC.

<p>

<h2><a name="SECTION00054000000000000000">
Routing via ACPI</a>
</h2>

<p>
The Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) was developed in
part to provide a unified interface to configuration management for
x86 machines&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node12.html#ACPI">1</a>].  Both the $PIR table and the MP Table are
among the configuration methods and tables merged into the ACPI
umbrella.  Thus, ACPI provides a unified interface to PCI interrupt
routing on x86 that replaces both $PIR and the MP Table.  There are
four main components to ACPI's interrupt routing support: global
system interrupts (GSIs), the global <tt>_PIC</tt> method, PCI
interrupt link devices, and per-PCI bus <tt>_PRT</tt> methods.

<p>

<h3><a name="SECTION00054100000000000000">
Global System Interrupts</a>
</h3>

<p>
ACPI uses a cookie system to ``name'' interrupts known as Global
System Interrupts.  Each interrupt controller input pin is assigned a
GSI using a fairly simple scheme.  For the 8259A case, the GSIs map
directly to ISA IRQs.  Thus, IRQ 0 is GSI 0, etc.  The APIC case is
slightly more complicated, but still simple.  Each I/O APIC is
assigned a base GSI by the BIOS.  Each input pin on the I/O APIC is
mapped to a GSI number by adding the pin number (zero-based) to the
base GSI.  Thus, if an I/O APIC has a base GSI of N, pin 0 on that I/O
APIC has a GSI of N, pin 1 has a GSI of N + 1, etc.  The I/O APIC with
a base GSI of 0 maps the ISA IRQs onto its first 16 input pins.  Thus,
the ISA IRQs are effectively always mapped 1:1 onto GSIs.  More
details about GSIs can be found in Section 5.2.11 of the ACPI 2.0c
spec&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node12.html#ACPIspec">2</a>].

<p>

<h3><a name="SECTION00054200000000000000">
The <tt>_PIC</tt> Method</a>
</h3>

<p>
The global <tt>_PIC</tt> method is a global ACPI function that the
operating system calls during boot to inform ACPI which set of
interrupt hardware it plans to use.  It accepts a single input
parameter which indicates the interrupt mode to use.  For x86
platforms, the parameter has two possible values: 0 indicates PIC mode
(that is, 8259As), and 1 indicates APIC mode.  The mode defaults to
PIC mode on boot.  Typically, the implementation of <tt>_PIC</tt>
saves the interrupt mode in a global variable that is used by
subsequent calls to <tt>_PRT</tt> methods to determine which routing
tables to return.  Figure&nbsp;<a href="#ACPI:PIC">5</a> contains a sample
implementation of <tt>_PIC</tt>.  More details can be found in
Section 5.8.1 of the ACPI 2.0c spec&nbsp;[<A

<h3><a name="SECTION00054300000000000000">
PCI Interrupt Link Devices</a>
</h3>

<p>
Each input pin on a programmable interrupt router is represented as a
device in the ACPI namespace.  These devices are called PCI interrupt
link devices and are identified with a PnP ID of <tt>PNP0C0F</tt>.
The destination of the link is set via an IRQ resource in the device's
resource list.  It is managed using the <tt>_CRS</tt>,
<tt>_PRS</tt>, and <tt>_SRS</tt> methods just like the IRQ resource
is managed for other ACPI devices such as built-in serial ports on the
LPC bus.

<p>
FreeBSD manages PCI interrupt link devices in much the same way it
handles links in the $PIR table.  One difference is that ACPI
provides a standard way to query the link for its current setting via
the <tt>_CRS</tt> method.  In practice, however, <tt>_CRS</tt> is
not always implemented, so the PCI interrupt link driver does examine
the PCI intline config register of any devices that use a link to
determine which IRQ, if any, the BIOS routed the link to.  Another
difference is that ACPI allows links to be turned off completely via
the <tt>_DIS</tt> method.  In fact, FreeBSD turns off all links
during boot and explicitly turns them on only when they are needed to
route interrupts.

<p>
Routing a link to an ISA IRQ follows much the same process for both
PCI interrupt link devices and $PIR links.  One difference is that
all PCI interrupt link devices are disabled during boot, so all of
them must be routed to an IRQ on first use.  However, the PCI
interrupt link device will simply route the link to the IRQ assigned
by the BIOS if the BIOS assigned one during boot and that IRQ is still
valid (the IRQ might not be valid if a link device is used in APIC
mode and has a different set of valid GSIs in APIC mode than in PIC
mode).  The PCI interrupt link driver builds a mask of known-good ISA
IRQs from the IRQs used by the BIOS similar to the $PIR driver.
However, ACPI doesn't provide a global mask of PCI-only IRQs similar
to the one found in the $PIR table header.  The PCI interrupt link
driver also does not include a static mask of possible ISA IRQs or
honor the <tt>hw.pci.irq_override_mask</tt> sysctl.  On the other
hand, the ACPI System Control Interrupt (SCI) is always shareable with
PCI interrupts, so it is added to the mask of known-good ISA IRQs when
in PIC mode.  Thus, there is always at least one IRQ in that mask when
operating in PIC mode, removing the need for both the global mask of
PCI-only IRQs and the static mask of possible ISA IRQs.

<p>
Routing a link to a non-ISA GSI is fairly simple.  In that case, there
aren't any complications with trying to determine which of the
possible interrupts really are usable.  Instead, all of the possible
GSIs are usable, and a simple weighting scheme is used to balance the
links across the available GSIs.

<p>
As with the $PIR code, the PCI interrupt link driver allows the user
to override the routing for individual links via tunables.  The format
of the tunable is <tt>hw.pci.link.<i>link</i>.irq</tt> where
<i>link</i> is the link to route, and the value of the tunable is the
GSI to route the link to.  The <i>link</i> is specified as the last
component of the PCI interrupt link devices path in the ACPI
namespace.  For example, to route the PCI interrupt link device
<tt>
<br>
_SB_.PCI0.ISA0.LNKA</tt> to ISA IRQ 11, set the loader tunable
<tt>hw.pci.link.LNKA.irq=11</tt>.  Unlike the $PIR code, any IRQs
used in user-specified routings are <i>not</i> included in the mask of
known-good ISA IRQs used by the BIOS.

<p>

<h3><a name="SECTION00054400000000000000">
<tt>_PRT</tt> Methods</a>
</h3>

<p>
The meat of PCI interrupt routing via ACPI is the <tt>_PRT</tt>
method.  Each PCI bus that ACPI provides interrupt routing information
for appears as a device in the ACPI namespace.  Each of these devices
contains a <tt>_PRT</tt> method that returns an array of objects
describing the interrupt routing for slots on that PCI bus.

<p>
Each object contains four members that describe the routing for a
single PCI interrupt.  The first member is an ACPI PCI address using
the same format as <tt>_ADR</tt>.  Thus, the upper four bytes contain
the slot, and the lower four bytes contain the function.  Since the
PCI function is not part of a PCI interrupt's address, it is always
specified as a wildcard value of <tt>0xFFFF</tt> and should be ignored
by the operating system.  The second member is a single byte
indicating the intpin.  A value of 0 specifies <tt>INTA#</tt>, 1
specifies <tt>INTB#</tt>, etc.

<p>
The third and fourth members define the destination of the interrupt.
If the third value is either zero or an empty string, then the fourth
value is a GSI and the PCI interrupt is hard-wired to that GSI.  This
type of mapping is just like the MP Table I/O interrupt entries which
map PCI interrupts to specific I/O APIC input pins.  If the third
value is not empty, then it is the name of a PCI interrupt link device
in the ACPI namespace, and the fourth value is a resource index.  The
resource index indicates which of the resources of the PCI interrupt
link device the interrupt is connected to.  In practice, though, some
BIOSes bogusly include a name of a link device even in entries that
are routed via a hardwired GSI, and no systems to date use a resource
index other than zero.  Thus, as a workaround for the busted systems,
FreeBSD ignores the third value and assumes the fourth value is a
hardwired GSI if the fourth value is not zero.  The <tt>_PRT</tt>

<p>
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#ACPI:PRT">6</a> contains a portion of an example <tt>_PRT</tt>.
Specifically, it includes the first entry in the table.  This
corresponds to the PCI interrupt for PCI bus 3, slot 7,
<tt>INTA#</tt> and can be compared with the routing for this same
interrupt in Figures&nbsp;<a href="#pirtool">3</a> and <a href="#mptable">4</a>.  First, note
there are actually two routing tables declared as constants:
<tt>PIC3</tt> is used for PIC mode, and <tt>APC3</tt> is used for APIC
mode.  The <tt>_PRT</tt> method checks the value of the <tt>PICF</tt>
global variable to determine which table to return to the operating
system.  Recall that <tt>PICF</tt> is set in the <tt>_PIC</tt> method
in Figure&nbsp;<a href="#ACPI:PIC">5</a>.  For PIC mode, the interrupt is routed to
the <tt>LNKC</tt> device, which is an ACPI PCI interrupt link device
corresponding to link 0x62 from the $PIR table.  For APIC mode, the
interrupt is routed to GSI 66.  For this machine, ACPI assigns a base
GSI of 64 to the I/O APIC with an APIC ID of 10.  Thus, GSI 66
corresponds to pin 2 on that I/O APIC which matches the routing in the
MP Table for this PCI interrupt.

<p>
Note that ACPI allows PCI interrupt link devices to be specified in
<tt>_PRT</tt> entries in APIC mode.  Thus, ACPI allows the BIOS to
communicate an interrupt routing where a PCI interrupt signal is
connected to an input pin on a programmable interrupt router whose
output pins are connected to arbitrary input pins on one or more I/O
APICs.  Neither the $PIR table or MP Table allow for this
configuration since the $PIR table assumes all IRQ values are less
than 16, and the MP Table assumes all PCI interrupts are mapped to
hardwired I/O APIC input pins.
